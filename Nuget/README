This directory is used to create the NuGet used by the "ETG Orleans Solution Template". 
This NuGet only works for this solution as it has a special structure and should not be installed manually in a project.

To create a new version of the NuGet, 
* Update the ETG.Orleans.nuspec file (bump version number, release notes, etc.).
* Replace the ETG.Orleans.dll and ETG.Orleans.CodeGen.dll with the new versions.
* Create the NuGet package by executing the following command.
```
nuget pack ETG.Orleans.nuspec
```
* Upload the new version of the package to the [NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ETG.Orleans/).
